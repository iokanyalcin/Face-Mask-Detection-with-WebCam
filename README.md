An re-implementation of Face Mask Detection Project with Mobilnetv2 network 

This is a real-time face detection project, which is based on MobileNet2 network.

Algorithm work flow:
Detect faces on the image.
Detect whether person/people wear mask/s or not.

It can also able to do detection on webcam, necessary comments added on the code.


The dataset and part of the code and network architecture inspired from from this project: https://github.com/chandrikadeb7/Face-Mask-Detection
