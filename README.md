# Face-Mask-Detection-with-WebCam


## Requirements
- Python 3.7 or higher
- Tensorflow/keras 2.0/1
- opencv / cv2

## Details about the project

- To run detection on webcam, run **detect_from_cam.py**
- To run detection from image, run **detect_from_image.py**

A re-implementation of Face Mask Detection Project with Mobilnetv2 network 

This is a real-time face detection project, which is based on MobileNet2 network.

## Algorithm work flow:
- Detect faces on the image.
- Detect whether person/people wear mask/s or not.

It can also able to do detection on webcam, necessary comments added on the code.
